### Best Practices:
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/guides/recommended-practices/index.html)
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.3/playbooks_best_practices.html)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

## Suggested steps
- [ ] Define repository structure
> Based on the technology stack, it is recommended to provide a structure for provisioning and orchestration of computing resources in the cloud, installation and configuration, environments containing dependencies such as docker files, continuous integration scripts, and other tools

- [ ] Find out or define by yourself a naming convention on the project
> As a example for the naming convention can be used prefix like: product or project; purposes like: test, build, tools, etc.; name like on-commit, daily, regression, cleaner, sanity; and finaly sufix if it needed, like: repository name, branch etc.
